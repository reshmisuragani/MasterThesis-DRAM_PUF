So you'd like to contribute to `rpi-open-firmware`?

First things first, please come on IRC before starting anything. While not strictly a rule, this prevents duplicate work. When you are ready after that, we accept pull requests over Github, or if you prefer you can email a patch or link to one over IRC.

A few notes on style:

* Contributors should use hard tabs.
* C++ is the preferred language for high-level code.
* Generally follow conventions of similar code in the project.
