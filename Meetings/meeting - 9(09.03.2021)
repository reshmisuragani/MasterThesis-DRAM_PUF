Student :  Reshmi Suragani

Status Report:
• need to start on  Machine learning for PUF Error correction code on both weak PUF/ Strong PUF

• For weak PUF SRAM PUF dataset will be used 
link : https://ieee-dataport.org/keywords/sram-puf  
(This directory containss 20 MSP430FR5969's SRAM DUMP data (binary files) at -15, 0, 25, 40 and 80 °C.
                                                        Each dump repeated for 100 times under the same condition )
link : https://gitlab.lrz.de/tueisec/PQAS/-/tree/master/matlab/datasets (this dataset was published by TUM university on 143 microcontrollers each device with 100 samples)

• For strong PUF - DRAM 
   we need to request Belfest university for more responses of Laptop DRAM PUF
