# Requirements

In order to build the firmware and kernel to use the DRAM PUF, a 32 bit Linux-based operating system is highly recommended. Otherwise, you need to install the following packages to be compatible with 32-bit applications:
```shell
sudo apt-get install lib32z1
sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5
```
